# About

- Hello My name is Sam brandon im a Frontend engineer and i built this application to showcase my ability with modern frameworks such as Sass. The Application is dynamically rendered but the components themselves while build with react/ts are relatively static html imo, compared to what they would be for a production level application the applications overall style and designed was by Jonas Schmedtmann.
